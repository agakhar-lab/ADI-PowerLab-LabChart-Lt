LabChart
I was working on a ADI Powerlab Labchart and was wondering if you could help me out. There is a new release for LabChart Lightning version or with LabChart 8. As you know if we are using a 2 channel powerlab both channel will start/stop acquisition when we hit start stop button. Can we write a code or program to make both channels start/stop independent of each other.
